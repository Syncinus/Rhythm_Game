# Rhythm_Game
Total rewrite of my old project "Natalius", now support XML based levels and is in semi-active development.

To run the game, download Unity (it uses Unity 2019.3, the current latest release), and then open it, and go to 
File -> Build and Run (or go to File -> Build Settings -> Build and Run to customize stuff).
