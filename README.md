# Rhythm_Game
Total rewrite of my old project "Natalius", now support XML based levels.

To run the game, download Unity (it uses Unity 2019.3, the current latest release), and then open it, and go to 
File -> Build and Run (or go to File -> Build Settings -> Build and Run to customize stuff).

Sadly the original level files are lost to time.
